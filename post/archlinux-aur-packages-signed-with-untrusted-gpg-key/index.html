    Archlinux and AUR packages signed With untrusted GPG key

</div>

            <div class="markdown">
                <p><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Archlinux</a> is my main (and currently used) Linux distribution. It might have a steep learning curve, but once configured, it will work like a charm. Just don&rsquo;t leave it be for few months and use something else in that time - because once back, you won&rsquo;t recognize how things had changed :)</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been mostly using CentOS &amp; RedHat Linux, I wanted to get back to Archlinux, just to see some recent changes. The easiest way of gradually going back, was to build my personal dev environment (&ldquo;playground&rdquo;) based on Arch. I had decided to create a set of <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> playbooks, which I could then use both from within <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and later use the same set of scripts to provision my laptop and / or PC.</p>

<p>Everything was going smoothly, until I started installing packages from <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository">AUR</a>. There&rsquo;s a whole separate back-story of the rationale behind my problem, but it boils down to the fact that in my Ansible playbooks I needed to be able to either automatically trust incoming GPG keys or disable that verification check.</p>

<p>Some quick googling brought me to those pages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/having-pacman-verify-packages/">Having pacman verify packages</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/news/gnupg-21-and-the-pacman-keyring/">GnuPG 2.1 and the pacman keyring</a></li>
<li><a href="http://allanmcrae.com/2015/01/two-pgp-keyrings-for-package-management-in-arch-linux/">Two PGP Keyrings for Package Management in Arch Linux</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pierre-schmitz.com/verify-all-the-packages/">Verify all the Packages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t had a chance to play with <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html">GnuPG 2.1</a> before, so instead of disabling the check, I opted for finding means of trusting the incoming keys automatically. (as this is just a dev env, for now). The final solution which I had decided to go for required addition of two simple tasks to my Ansible role.</p>

<p>To use an example, if I wanted to install <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kafka/"><code>kafka</code> from AUR</a> (which was failing, because I didn&rsquo;t trust the keys used to sign that package), I needed to add:</p>

<pre><code>- name: import gpg keys
  sudo: yes
  sudo_user: &quot;{{ makepkg_nonroot_user }}&quot;
  command: gpg --recv-key {{ item }}
  with_items:
    - 865187967F1183BD
    - 14B7C839C4F7D536A7BC9CAB865187967F1183BD

- name: trust required gpg keys
  sudo: yes
  sudo_user: &quot;{{ makepkg_nonroot_user }}&quot;
  command: printf 'trust\n5\ny\nquit\n' | gpg --no-permission-warning --command-fd 0 --edit-key 14B7C839C4F7D536A7BC9CAB865187967F1183BD
</code></pre>

<p>By using <code>sudo: yes</code> and setting the user to the one stored in <code>makepkg_nonroot_user</code> variable, I&rsquo;m stating that task is being run as the non-root user who will later be used to install specific package. Command in second step is saying that I&rsquo;m giving ultimate trust to specified key (only do so if you really trust the key!). It uses piping of input to standard <code>gpg</code> <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/r899.html"><code>edit-key</code></a> command, with the actions being read from standard input (<code>--command-fd 0</code> sets file descriptor of command to <code>0</code> which is <code>stdin</code>).</p>

<p>The command which we&rsquo;re passing:</p>

<pre><code>trust
5
y
quit
</code></pre>

<p>was just an invocation of trusting a key, with highest level (5), confirming it with <code>y</code> and quitting the edit mode.</p>
