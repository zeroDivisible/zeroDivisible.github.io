      <description>Archlinux is a really interesting Linux distribution - and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite ones. It might have a steep learning curve, but once you dig into it, it will work like a charm. Unless you will switch to some distro and want to come back after an undefined period of time.
As recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly using CentOS &amp;amp; RedHat Linux, I wanted to get back to Archlinux, just to spice things a little and see what&amp;rsquo;s going on in with my favorite distro.</description>
