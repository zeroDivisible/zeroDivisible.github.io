      <description>Archlinux is my main (and currently used) Linux distribution. It might have a steep learning curve, but once configured, it will work like a charm. Just don&amp;rsquo;t leave it be for few months and use something else in that time - because once back, you won&amp;rsquo;t recognize how things had changed :)
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly using CentOS &amp;amp; RedHat Linux, I wanted to get back to Archlinux, just to see some recent changes.</description>

      <title>GPG Keys</title>

      <description>From time to time I have a need to work with GPG keys - (i.e. when dealing with third party interfaces and encrypting files to be send). Usually keys which I&amp;rsquo;m using are being delivered to me - but especially when developing (&amp;amp; testing), I have a need to go back to command line and use gpg from within it. As each time when I&amp;rsquo;m doing so, I have to either read man for GPG or use Google, I just thought that I will put some of the most common things which I&amp;rsquo;m using in the blog post.</description>
