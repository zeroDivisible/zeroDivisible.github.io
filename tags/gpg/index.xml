      <description>Archlinux is a really interesting Linux distribution - and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite ones. It might have a steep learning curve, but once you dig into it, it will work like a charm. Unless you will switch to some distro and want to come back after an undefined period of time.
As recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly using CentOS &amp;amp; RedHat Linux, I wanted to get back to Archlinux, just to spice things a little and see what&amp;rsquo;s going on in with my favorite distro.</description>

      <title>GPG Keys</title>

      <description>From time to time I have a need to work with GPG keys - (i.e. when dealing with third party interfaces and encrypting files to be send). Usually keys which I&amp;rsquo;m using are being delivered to me - but especially when developing (&amp;amp; testing), I have a need to go back to command line and use gpg from within it. As each time when I&amp;rsquo;m doing so, I have to either read man for GPG or use Google, I just thought that I will put some of the most common things which I&amp;rsquo;m using in the blog post.</description>
