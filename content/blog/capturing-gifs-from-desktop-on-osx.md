From time to time, I'm finding a need to record a portion of my desktop, upload it and share with somebody. On OSX, one way which worked for me was using a nifty tool called [GifGrabber](http://www.gifgrabber.com/).

Available for free from the App Store, makes the whole process as painless as it can be. Features are limitied, but honestly - it has exactly what you want: you can capture a part of desktop, edit it, setting the starting point, and upload it to [gfycat](http://gfycat.com), getting a link in return.

Awesome!

Highly recommended.
