From time to time, I'm finding a need to record a portion of my desktop, upload it and share with somebody. On OSX, the easiest way of doing so which I had found is by using a nifty tool called [GifGrabber](http://www.gifgrabber.com/).

Available for free from the App Store, makes the whole process as painless as it can be. Features are limitied, but honestly - it has exactly what you want from a tool which is called GifGrabber: you can capture a part of desktop, edit it to fine-tune starting point and an end and upload it to [gfycat](http://gfycat.com), having a link in return.

Awesome!

Highly recommended.
