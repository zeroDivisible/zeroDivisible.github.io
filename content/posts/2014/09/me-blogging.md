Title: Me Blogging

I think that I had started around 5 or 6 different blogs - from sophisticated contraptions, using Wordpress, Drupal or Joomla, to two different blogs build using static engine generators. The fun part of that project was setting everything up: configuring the servers, blogging engines, even figuring out how those static site generators work. But once everything was up and running, when I had a blog which can be used to publish new content, then, well, excitement related with playing with new tools faded away.

This time, I will try to make it differently - the idea being, that the more I will write, the better my English will be. I don't want to make any fixed commitments, but I'll try to publish even if a short note, at least once a week. If I'll have an opportunity to write more than that - great, but I'll be totally happy with me being able to just have something created, once a week.

Maybe this time I will not abandon my idea after the very first week.
